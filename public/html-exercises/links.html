        <h2>Top Picks: A Blog of my Bests and Greatests</h2>
        <em> My Top 3 movie picks.</em>
        <p> My third all time favorite movie is the newly released <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610/"> Jurrasic World </a>
        , this is one of my favorite movies because i'm an avid fan of prehistoric creatures especially dinosaurs.</br>
        The story was good, the actors were great in portraying their role my fav. character was Chris Pratt aka <em>Star Lord</em> who learned to tame a group of raptors to follow his</br>
        command. The main conflict of the story was also good, the genetically created <em>Indominus Rex</em> was bad ass. The whole movie was great, fun to watch, and higly reccommended </br>
        for all dino fans alike.</p>
        <p> The 2nd movie that i like the most is the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/collection/295-pirates-of-the-caribbean-collection"> Pirates of the Caribbean movie series</a>
        , well who wouldn't like pirates who hunts for treasures in the deep, with their uncanny crew, </br> magnificient ships, swashbuckling action, and comedic acts that
        will make you laugh your hearts out. The main character <em>Capt. Jack Sparrow</em> portaryed by <em>Johnny Depp</em> was great, </br> watching him act and get his ass out of bad situations was really good.
        Over all the film was good and I consider it as one of the best series of movies ever.</p>
        <p> Finally the top spot on my movie list belongs to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000671664/"> Harry Potter series</a>. The film was based on the top selling book by <em> J.K Rowling</em>
        and it captured the imagination of young and adults </br> alike all around the globe. Well who wouldn't want to recieve a letter that says you are admitted to <em> Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, </em>
        admit it all of us wants to learn magic, </br> learn spells, ride broomsticks, meet fascinating creatures, and best of all play Quidditch. All in all the series were great,
        yes some parts in the book were not included in the movies but </br> still I consider it the best movie series I have watched. </p>

        <em>The top 3 songs of my playlist</em>
        <p> My third favorite song of all time is  <a href="http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/WORLD_END"> World End</a>, The song is arranged and sang by the band called <em> FLOW </em> and it is the opening theme of my favorite anime <em> Code Geass </em>,
        yes the lyrics </br> of the song is japanese, but everytime it plays I remember the epic fights, cliff hangers, side story, characters, and the epic ending of my fav. anime.</p>
        <p> The second song I like is <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_for_This_Girl"> Crazy for this girl </a>, by <em> Evan and Jaron </em> the song was released in the  late 2000, and it became the soundtrack of an 
        american drama series entitled <em> Dawsons Creek </em>. </br> The song is a bit old but i prefer to listen to songs created on this timeline because i think they are better than the songs playing now.</p>
        <p> Finally my most favorite song of all time is <a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/callalily/insane.html"> Insane</a>, by <em>Callalily</em> I like this song because i like the band that made it, of course i recognized Callalily as one of 
        the best OPM bands in the country, </br> the lyrics is good, and the rhythm is catchy plus it is easy to play in the guitar. </p>
